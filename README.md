## Source Code Documentation 

Per instructions of the HW Module 5, the README file reserved for specifying source code and location within the repo. 

Source code was derived through classwork assignments. I'm certifying that there was no third-party input. 

My codes can be found in the Python Notebook File under "Instructions" >> Starter_Code and the Notebook assignment is called "financial-planner".
